This is a noobs Android project to create a To-do list. In addition to the Android/Java code, this project also includes Ruby/Sinatra code to provide a RESTful server. There are three directories:
1. Server - which contains the Ruby/Sinatra code.
2. Client - which contains the non-Android, Java code that was used to test the server comms.
3. Android - the Android client code which includes the code from the Client directory.
More development is required to turn this into something useful but, in it's current state, it provides a useful starting point for someone wanting to experiment with shared To-do lists.
